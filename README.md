# Conflict Tracker 

Conflict Tracker is a Flutter application designed for tracking conflicts in the forest. It provides a comprehensive solution with separate admin and user interfaces, backed by Firebase for seamless real-time data management. 🌳

## 📚 Introduction

Tracking and monitoring conflicts in their natural habitat is crucial for conservation efforts. Conflict Tracker aims to streamline this process by leveraging the power of mobile technology and cloud-based backend solutions. The project provides an intuitive and efficient solution for both administrators and field guards to track and manage tiger sightings.

## 🌟 Features

Conflict Tracker offers a range of features for administrators and field guards:

### Administrator Features:

- **User/Guard Management**: Admin can perform CRUD operations on user/guard accounts, manage their permissions, and track their activities.
- **Conflict Map Visualization**: The admin interface displays all conflict sightings on an interactive map, with markers representing their locations. Admin can perform CRUD operations on conflict entries directly from the map.
- **Real-time Data Management**: All changes made by the admin or field guards are synchronized in real-time using Firebase, ensuring data consistency across all devices.
- **Authentication and Access Control**: Secure authentication system with role-based access control ensures only authorized individuals can access the admin interface.

### Field Guard Features:

- **Conflict Sighting**: Guards can add new conflict sightings by capturing images using the device camera or selecting them from the gallery. They can also enter additional information about the conflict, such as location, time, and behavior.
- **Live Location Tracking**: Guards' live location is tracked and updated in real-time to provide accurate location data for conflict sightings.
- **Data Export**: Guards have the option to export conflict sighting data as an Excel sheet for further analysis and reporting.
- **Search and Filter**: Guards can search for specific conflict sightings based on various criteria, such as date, location, or conflict attributes.
- **Authentication**: Guards are authenticated using Firebase authentication to ensure secure access to the application.
